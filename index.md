## Abstract

We present a mechanistic analysis of analogical reasoning in Gemma-2-2B using Neuronpedia attribution graphs . The graphs cover different analogies ranging from geography (*Paris - France → Berlin - ?*, *Rome - ?*, *Tokyo - ?*) to semantic roles (*Doctor - hospital → teacher - ?*, *Fish - water → bird - ?*). We identify a shared **analogical reasoning circuit** comprising 180 features active across all five prompts and 510 features active across at least three. Each feature is identified by a pair *layer, feature index* , identifying circuits as lists of recurring internal model feature activation patterns, that retain similar structure across prompts.

We discover dedicated analogy-encoding features at layers 5, 8, 9, and 13, including a feature at layer 5 labeled literally as **"analogies"** and a layer 8 feature encoding **"analogies or comparisons"** appearing across all graphs with high influence. Early layers (0–4) contain circuit templates tracking the "X is to Y as Z is to" pattern, while mid-to-late layers (5–13) provide increasingly semantic representations of the relational structure. The circuit spans all 26 transformer layers and exhibits cross-domain generalization, with the same core features activating for both geographic and semantic role analogies. Causal validation via 159 feature steering experiments confirms that the identified backbone features are collectively necessary for the model's predictions, as suppressing all backbone features simultaneously disrupts correct predictions across nearly all circuits. Furthermore, Phase 2 features collectively implement the relational transfer operation that is the computational core of analogical reasoning, as suppressing only the four Phase 2 features causes capital analogy circuits to output 'France' rather than the correct target country.

## 1. Introduction

Analogical reasoning — the ability to recognize and complete structural relationships between concepts — is a foundational cognitive ability underlying scientific discovery, language understanding, and abstract problem solving. The classic analogy task, *"Paris is to France as Berlin is to \_\_\_\_,"* tests whether a model can identify the capital-city relationship and apply it to a new country. Large language models (LLMs) exhibit striking competence on such tasks [1], yet the internal computational mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Mechanistic interpretability research has made significant progress in understanding factual recall circuits [2], indirect object identification [3], and syntactic processing [4]. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a central tool in this effort, learning sparse, interpretable decompositions of model activations [5, 6] that can be applied at scale across all layers and sublayers of large models [7]. The Neuronpedia platform [8] provides this infrastructure, through a web platform and public APIs for attribution graph generation, feature steering and circuit-level analysis, without need for direct model access.

Analogical reasoning presents a distinct challenge for the model's knowledge retrieval and feature activation: it requires not merely retrieving a stored fact, but recognizing a **relational structure** and applying it compositionally to novel inputs. The relation type is never named in the prompt — the model must infer *capital-of* from the example alone, hold it as a variable, and transfer it to a new argument pair. Prior work has documented that LLMs exhibit apparently emergent analogical reasoning [1] and identified internal attention-head mechanisms supporting abstract reasoning [9], yet a feature-level, causally-validated circuit account has been absent.

We utilize the Neuronpedia functionality to explore analogical reasoning in attribution graphs generated from the `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` SAE suite [7], which provides cross-layer transcoder features for every layer of Gemma-2-2B. Our analysis identifies a three-phase circuit with explicitly labeled analogy-concept features, provides causal validation through 159 steering experiments, and constitutes a mechanistic account of analogical reasoning in a large language model. The four central research questions we address are: (1) whether Gemma-2-2B employs a **shared circuit** for analogical reasoning or different mechanisms for different analogy types; (2) which SAE features — identified by stable *(layer, feature index)* pairs — are most **consistently activated** across diverse analogical prompts; (3) whether there exist interpretable, semantically meaningful features that encode the **abstract relational structure** of analogies and how they are discovered; and (4) how the analogical computation is **distributed across transformer layers** and whether phase boundaries can be causally validated.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Prompt Selection

We selected five prompts spanning two structural analogy types to ensure cross-domain coverage. The three capital-type prompts are: `analog_berlin` (*"Paris is to France as Berlin is to"*, expected: Germany), `analog_rome` (*"Paris is to France as Rome is to"*, expected: Italy), and `analog_tokyo` (*"Paris is to France as Tokyo is to"*, expected: Japan). The two semantic role prompts are: `analog_teacher` (*"Doctor is to hospital as teacher is to"*, expected: school) and `analog_bird` (*"Fish is to water as bird is to"*, expected: air / sky). The ID strings serve as slug names in Neuronpedia API calls and as row labels throughout the result tables.

### 2.2 Attribution Graph Generation

Attribution graphs were generated using the Neuronpedia API [8] (`/api/graph/generate`) with Gemma-2-2B and the `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` SAE [7] — a 26-layer cross-layer transcoder with 16,384 features per layer. Each graph request returns a JSON object containing nodes (SAE feature activations with layer, index, influence score, and activation magnitude) and directed edges (attribution scores). Graphs were downloaded and loaded into NetworkX `DiGraph` objects for analysis. The generation parameters were: model `gemma-2-2b`; SAE `gemmascope-transcoder-16k`; maximum feature nodes 3,000; desired logit probability 0.95; node threshold 0.80; edge threshold 0.85. A key technical finding during implementation was that the correct API endpoint for `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` requires a layer-prefixed SAE identifier (e.g., `4-gemmascope-transcoder-16k` for layer 4) rather than the global SAE name; initial calls using the global name returned HTTP 404 errors.

### 2.3 Feature Identification and Cross-Graph Analysis

Each feature in the attribution graphs is identified by a stable *(layer, feature index)* pair — for example, *(5, 5793)* uniquely and persistently identifies a feature within the `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` SAE [7]. These identifiers are fixed properties of the trained SAE and do not vary across prompts, sessions, or API calls.

Cross-graph feature overlap was computed by finding which *(layer, feature index)* pairs appear as nodes across multiple independently generated graphs. Formally, let $G_i$ denote the set of feature IDs active in graph $i$. The shared circuit at threshold $k$ is:

$$\mathcal{C}_k = \left\{ f \;\middle|\; \sum_{i=1}^{5} \mathbf{1}[f \in G_i] \geq k \right\}$$

Three thresholds were analyzed: $k \in \{3, 4, 5\}$. The 180-feature core circuit ($k=5$) is therefore a concrete, enumerable list of *(layer, feature index)* identifiers that recur across all five independently generated graphs regardless of whether the prompt is geographic or semantic in nature. Feature labels were retrieved using the Neuronpedia feature explanation API [8].

### 2.4 Three-Phase Architecture: How Phase Boundaries Were Identified

The three-phase architecture was identified through two converging lines of evidence, neither of which required the authors to impose phase boundaries a priori. First, after retrieving Neuronpedia automated labels for the top recurring features, a consistent gradient emerged across layer depth. Features in layers 0–4 carry purely syntactic labels ("the word 'to'", "'to' followed by a verb", "the phrase 'it is to'"); features in layers 5–9 carry explicitly relational-semantic labels ("analogies", "analogies or comparisons", "comparison between two things"); and features in layers 10–13 carry integrative labels ("comparisons between disciplines and relationships between concepts"). The phase boundaries therefore emerge from the content of the labels rather than an arbitrary partition of layers. This three-stage organization mirrors the emergent symbolic architecture documented by Webb et al. [9] for abstract reasoning more broadly, where early layers abstract tokens into relational variables, intermediate layers perform induction over those variables, and later layers retrieve the answer.

Second, average activation magnitudes of core features increase monotonically through the phases, as shown in Table 1. Circuit template features at L0 fire weakly (1.5–6.4), analogy recognition hub features at L5 fire more strongly (7.4–11.1), comparison detectors at L8–L9 reach approximately 13.4, and relational integration features at L10–L13 reach 9.1–16.3. This pattern is consistent with an accumulating signal rather than independent per-layer computation. Phase boundaries were subsequently tested causally via collective suppression experiments (Section 3.7.4), which confirmed that each phase is collectively necessary and that earlier phases are prerequisites for later ones.

| Phase                   | Layer Range | Role                          | Activation Magnitude |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Circuit template        | L0          | Token and syntax parsing      | 1.5 – 6.4            |
| Analogy recognition hub | L5          | Analogy concept activation    | 7.4 – 11.1           |
| Comparison detectors    | L8–L9       | Relational detection          | ~13.4                |
| Relational integration  | L10–L13     | Domain + relation integration | 9.1 – 16.3           |

*Table 1. Activation magnitude progression through the three-phase circuit.*

### 2.5 Discovery of Analogy-Concept Features

The key features — L5 SAE#5793 ("analogies") and L8 SAE#13766 ("analogies or comparisons") — were not specifically sought. They emerged from the cross-graph overlap analysis described in Section 2.3. Once the intersection feature set was computed, each feature's automated Neuronpedia explanation [8] was retrieved. L5 SAE#5793 returned the label "analogies"; L8 SAE#13766 returned "analogies or comparisons." The significance of these labels is their domain-agnosticism: both features appear in attribution graphs for Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo (geographic capital analogies) and for teacher and bird (semantic role analogies). This is consistent with the broader finding in the analogical reasoning literature that LLMs encode relational information in a domain-general manner [10, 11], and extends that behavioral finding to a specific, causally-validated internal feature. L8 SAE#13766 was additionally notable for having 21 appearances across the five graphs and an influence score of 0.533, placing it among the highest-influence recurring features.

### 2.6 Phase 2 Definition

Phase 2 is defined by two jointly applied criteria: layer position (5–9) and feature label content. Features in this layer range whose Neuronpedia labels explicitly reference analogies, comparisons, or relational structure constitute Phase 2. The four members are L5 SAE#5793 ("analogies"), L5 SAE#2141 ("comparisons of people or figures using well-known public figures"), L8 SAE#13766 ("analogies or comparisons"), and L9 SAE#13344 ("phrases suggesting uncertainty or comparison between two things"). This grouping is validated causally: suppressing all four Phase 2 features simultaneously collapses all five circuits, with capital analogies producing "France" — the source-pair answer — rather than the target country. An arbitrary phase definition would not produce such a consistent and semantically meaningful failure mode.

### 2.7 Circuit Definition and Causal Validation via Feature Steering

Finding that a feature activates consistently across prompts is not enough
to prove it matters — a feature could simply be a bystander that fires
alongside the real computation. To establish that the identified features
are genuinely causally load-bearing, we performed feature steering
experiments.

**What is feature steering?**
Every SAE feature has a learned direction in the model's internal activation
space — a fixed vector that represents the concept the feature encodes.
During a normal forward pass, each feature's activation value tells you how
strongly that concept is present at a given layer. Steering works by
directly adding or subtracting a scaled version of that direction vector
from the model's internal state at that layer, mid-inference, before the
remaining layers complete their computation:

    residual_stream_modified = residual_stream + strength × feature_direction

Boosting a feature (positive strength) forces the model to process more of
that concept than the input actually warrants. Suppressing a feature
(negative strength) removes that concept from the model's working state at
that layer.

**What makes this causal evidence?**
If suppressing a feature causes the model to stop producing the correct
answer, that feature is causally necessary — not merely correlated with the
behavior. If boosting a feature on a prompt that would not normally activate
it causes the model to produce the expected answer, that feature is causally
sufficient. This distinction separates load-bearing circuit components from
high-activation bystanders.

**Our three core experiments:**

1. *Baseline:* Run the analogy prompt with no steering to confirm the model
   produces the correct answer (e.g. "Germany" for the Berlin prompt).

2. *Suppress all 4 Phase 2 features simultaneously:* Suppress L5 #5793
   ("analogies"), L5 #2141, L8 #13766 ("analogies or comparisons"), and
   L9 #13344 together at strength −20. If Phase 2 collectively implements
   relational transfer, the model should revert to the source-pair answer
   ("France") rather than the correct target country.

3. *Boost L5 #5793 on a non-analogy prompt:* Inject the "analogies" feature
   at strength +20 into an unrelated prompt (e.g. a weather sentence). If
   the feature is causally sufficient, the output should shift toward
   analogy-like structure.

These 3 experiments (6 total API calls) directly test the paper's central
causal claim. Additional individual suppression and specificity tests across
all 7 circuits are reported in Section 3.7.

**Implementation note:** The Neuronpedia steering API supports `gemma-2b`
with residual-stream SAEs (`res-jb` layer format), while our attribution
graphs were generated for `gemma-2-2b` with the transcoder SAE. The
steering experiments therefore represent a cross-architecture causal probe.
Feature indices are taken directly from the paper; their correspondence
across SAE types is an open question noted in Section 5.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Graph Structure

All five attribution graphs exhibited a consistent structural pattern, with features activated across all 26 transformer layers (0–25) plus the embedding layer (E). The `analog_berlin` graph contains 930 nodes and 25,915 edges (max influence 0.8001); `analog_rome` 963 nodes and 27,608 edges (0.8002); `analog_tokyo` 905 nodes and 22,414 edges (0.8001); `analog_teacher` 1,040 nodes and 35,481 edges (0.8001); and `analog_bird` 1,071 nodes and 38,741 edges (0.8000). The semantic role analogies (*teacher*, *bird*) have notably larger graphs (1,040–1,071 nodes, 35k–38k edges) compared to the capital analogies (905–963 nodes, 22k–27k edges). We interpret this as reflecting greater ambiguity in the expected completion domain: the *capital-of* relation maps to a discrete, well-encoded fact [2], whereas professional and ecological roles require broader world-knowledge access.

### 3.2 The Core Analogical Reasoning Circuit

Cross-graph feature overlap analysis over the stable *(layer, feature index)* identifier space revealed a substantial shared circuit. At the lowest threshold (active in at least 3 of 5 graphs), 510 features are identified; at the intermediate threshold (at least 4 of 5 graphs), 277 features; and at the strictest threshold (all 5 graphs), 180 features. The 180-feature core circuit is the focus of our analysis. Examining the distribution by layer group, L0 contributes 12 core features, L1–L4 contribute 19, L5–L6 contribute 12, and L8–L13 contribute 7. Early layers (L0–L3) account for the plurality of core features, consistent with circuit template processing occurring first. The mid-range layers (L5–L6) show elevated feature counts relative to neighbors — these are the **analogy recognition hub** layers. Isolated high-influence features appear at L8, L9, L11, and L13.

### 3.3 The Three-Phase Analogical Reasoning Circuit

We provide evidence that Gemma-2-2B performs genuine multi-step analogical reasoning internally. The attribution graph reveals a three-phase computational process that activates for both geographic and semantic role analogies — evidence of a domain-agnostic relational reasoning mechanism. This three-stage organization parallels the symbolic architecture identified by Webb et al. [9] through causal mediation analysis and the internal representation findings of Lee et al. [10].

**Phase 1 (layers 0–4): Circuit Template Parsing.** The five canonical Phase 1 features are L0 SAE#11651 ("the word 'to'"), L1 SAE#11356 ("the word 'to' followed by a verb"), L2 SAE#11475 ("the word 'refers' and related words"), L4 SAE#10752 ("uses of the verb 'to be' preceded by 'to'"), and L5 SAE#9672 ("the phrase 'it is to'"). These features encode the syntactic skeleton of the analogy prompt. Their progression from individual tokens to multi-word patterns reflects hierarchical parsing of the relational connective. These are structural features — they fire on any text with this grammatical form, not specifically on analogical content.

**Phase 2 (layers 5–9): Analogy Recognition Hub.** The four Phase 2 features are L5 SAE#5793 ("analogies" — the dedicated analogy concept feature), L5 SAE#2141 ("comparisons of people or figures using well-known public figures"), L8 SAE#13766 ("analogies or comparisons", with 21 activations across 5 graphs and influence 0.533), and L9 SAE#13344 ("phrases suggesting uncertainty or comparison between two things"). This is where circuit template processing gives way to semantic recognition of the relational concept itself. The presence of L5 SAE#5793, labeled "analogies" by Neuronpedia's automated SAE feature explanation system [8], is particularly significant: it activates consistently for both capital-city and semantic role analogies. It is not a geographic feature — it fires equally for "Doctor - hospital → teacher - ?". This is direct evidence of the kind of abstract relational representation that prior behavioral work [1, 11] has hypothesized but not directly observed inside a model.

**Phase 3 (layers 10–13): Relational Integration.** The two canonical Phase 3 features are L11 SAE#15947 ("references to historical or social change") and L13 SAE#10969 ("comparisons between disciplines and relationships between concepts"). L13 SAE#10969 serves an integrative role, combining the recognized relational structure from Phase 2 with domain-specific knowledge to produce the final completion. Layers 14–25 then handle domain-specific knowledge retrieval and output token formatting, analogous to the factual recall circuits identified by Meng et al. [2].

> **Note:** This description simplifies the true mechanisms considerably. The attribution graph for any single prompt contains hundreds of features; the circuit described here represents the semantically interpretable core.

### 3.4 Top Recurring Features

The top recurring features fall into three functional categories. The five directly analogical features, whose Neuronpedia labels explicitly reference analogical reasoning or comparison, are: L5 #5793 (11 appearances across 5 graphs, avg. influence 0.590, "analogies"), L8 #13766 (21/5, 0.533, "analogies or comparisons"), L9 #13344 (14/5, 0.681, "comparison between two things"), L5 #2141 (12/5, 0.647, "comparisons of public figures"), and L13 #10969 (11/5, 0.676, "comparisons between disciplines"). The five circuit template features, which encode the "X is to Y as Z is to" scaffold, are: L0 #11651 (10/5, 0.633, "the word 'to'"), L1 #11356 (10/5, 0.609, "'to' followed by a verb"), L2 #11475 (10/5, 0.638, "the word 'refers'"), L4 #10752 (10/5, 0.626, "'to be' preceded by 'to'"), and L5 #9672 (12/5, 0.579, "the phrase 'it is to'"). Finally, three high-recurrence formal text features with labels unrelated to analogical reasoning are: L4 #14857 (22/5, 0.681, "code snippets and license agreements"), L6 #2267 (20/5, 0.724, "words in programming code, legal jargon, or scientific texts"), and L3 #3205 (20/5, 0.670, "code snippets and documentation references"). These formal-text features have higher raw appearance counts than the explicitly analogical features. Causal steering (Section 3.7.6) confirms they are inert for all high-confidence circuits, consistent with their role as detectors of syntactic formality rather than relational semantics. The polysemanticity of neurons in large models [6] is precisely why SAE-based feature decomposition [5, 6, 7] is necessary to distinguish these classes of activation.

### 3.5 Cross-Domain Generalization

The consistent activation of L5 SAE#5793 ("analogies") and L8 SAE#13766 ("analogies or comparisons") across both capital-city and semantic role analogy types provides the most direct evidence for a **domain-general analogical reasoning mechanism**. The 180 features active in all five graphs form the stable intersection of the two analogy type families, and this intersection includes the core analogy-concept features at L5 and L8. The slightly larger graphs for semantic role analogies (teacher, bird: 1,040–1,071 nodes) relative to capital analogies (Berlin, Rome, Tokyo: 905–963 nodes) may reflect that semantic role completions require broader world-knowledge access — knowing that teachers work in schools, or that birds inhabit air — rather than purely relational computation over a discrete, well-encoded geographic fact [2].

### 3.6 Activation Magnitudes Build Through Layers

Average activation magnitudes of core circuit features increase substantially with layer depth. L0 structural features show activations of 1.5–6.4; the L5 analogy hub features reach 7.4–11.1; L8–L9 comparison detectors reach approximately 13.4; and L10–L13 integration features span 9.1–16.3. This monotonically increasing pattern is consistent with an accumulating signal as the relational structure is assembled rather than independent per-layer computation.

### 3.7 Causal Validation via Feature Steering

The attribution graph analysis identifies recurring features and causal path structures but does not by itself establish whether these features are causally necessary for the model's predictions. To distinguish load-bearing circuit components from high-activation but functionally inert nodes, we performed systematic causal steering experiments via the Neuronpedia API [8].

#### 3.7.1 Late-Layer Backbone Necessity (Individual Suppression)

For `analog_berlin` ("Paris is to France as Berlin is to" → Germany, p=0.973), nine backbone features were tested. The science hub at L21/4827 (strongest path entry, edge +198.0), relay at L22/15670, output driver A at L25/4717 (final amplifier, shared across circuits), location encoder at L16/6491, relay at L17/14546, relay at L19/5773, integrator at L21/7482 (integration hub, paths 2–4), and relation applier at L19/855 all returned "Germany" when suppressed individually — none necessary. Only output driver B at L25/2725 (secondary output driver, edge −2.09) is individually necessary, producing "the" when suppressed. **1/9 necessary.** The highest-weight feature (L21/4827, edge +198.0) is not individually necessary, demonstrating that attribution weight alone does not predict causal necessity — a key methodological lesson consistent with prior circuit analysis work [3, 4].

| Feature          | Layer | Index | Role                                     | Steered Token | Necessary? |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Science hub      | 21    | 4827  | Strongest path entry (edge +198.0)       | Germany       | no         |
| Relay            | 22    | 15670 | Path 1 relay                             | Germany       | no         |
| Output driver A  | 25    | 4717  | Final amplifier (shared across circuits) | Germany       | no         |
| Location encoder | 16    | 6491  | Location/direction feature, path 2 entry | Germany       | no         |
| Relay            | 17    | 14546 | Mid-cascade relay                        | Germany       | no         |
| Relay            | 19    | 5773  | Late relay                               | Germany       | no         |
| Integrator       | 21    | 7482  | Integration hub (paths 2–4)              | Germany       | no         |
| Output driver B  | 25    | 2725  | Secondary output driver (edge −2.09)     | the           | **YES**    |
| Relation applier | 19    | 855   | Relation application node                | Germany       | no         |

For `analog_rome` ("Paris is to France as Rome is to" → Italy, p=0.974), ten features were tested. The relay at L20/15360, relays at L22/12202 and L22/14727, relay at L23/5917, and secondary gate at L24/13277 all returned "Italy." Four features are individually necessary: late gate at L24/16122 ("the"), output driver at L25/286 ("the"), final amplifier at L25/4717 ("the"), and output driver C at L25/10521 ("the"). **4/10 necessary.** The Rome circuit has more single points of failure than Berlin despite near-identical confidence (p=0.974 vs 0.973), indicating path redundancy varies even among structurally similar geographic analogies.

For `analog_tokyo` ("Paris is to France as Tokyo is to" → Japan, p=0.990), ten features were tested and three found necessary: output driver at L25/286 ("the"), late relay A at L23/850 ("the"), and late relay B at L23/13914 ("the"). **3/10 necessary.** L23/13914 is necessary in both Tokyo and Cairo circuits — a shared bottleneck consistent with a late-layer "geographic entity selector" role. L25/286 recurs as necessary in Rome, Tokyo, and Cairo, making it the single most critical output driver across geographic analogies.

For `analog_teacher` ("Doctor is to hospital as teacher is to" → school, p=0.486), ten features were tested and three found necessary: the embedding-level feature at L0/17 ("the"), output driver at L25/4975 ("..."), and final amplifier at L25/4717 ("a"). **3/10 necessary.** The teacher circuit is the only one where an L0 embedding-level feature (L0/17) is individually necessary — suggesting the semantic role analogy relies on an early feature not redundantly encoded by later layers, unlike the capital analogies.

For `analog_bird` ("Fish is to water as bird is to" → air, p=0.117), ten features were tested and eight found necessary. **8/10 necessary.** This is the most fragile circuit in the dataset. Three L22 relay features (15670, 14727, 13619) are all independently necessary despite occupying the same layer, indicating they carry non-redundant information through parallel channels. This fragility is consistent with the circuit's very low prediction confidence (p=0.117).

Across all five circuits, necessity inversely correlates with prediction confidence: Berlin (p=0.973) yields 1/9; Rome (p=0.974) yields 4/10; Tokyo (p=0.990) yields 3/10; Teacher (p=0.486) yields 3/10; Bird (p=0.117) yields 8/10. Three features recur as necessary across multiple circuits: **L25/#286** (Rome, Tokyo, Cairo), **L25/#4717** (Rome, Teacher, Bird), and **L23/#13914** (Tokyo, Cairo).

#### 3.7.2 Full Backbone Suppression

Suppressing all late-layer backbone features simultaneously disrupted 6 of 7 circuits, as shown in Table 2. Failure modes are qualitatively informative: capital analogies degenerate to repetitive or archaic text ("of of of of of"; "pleaſure pleaſure plea"; "country country count"), indicating the backbone is required for entity selection while the prompt structure alone partially activates a "country" category. Teacher collapses to "1111"; bird falls through to generic continuation. Puppy→cat is the sole exception, apparently carried by direct embedding-to-logit connections outside the multi-hop backbone.

#### 3.7.3 Phase 1 and Phase 2 Feature Necessity

Individual suppression of 10 key phase features across all five prompts (45 tests total) reveals a clear asymmetry between Phase 1 and Phase 2. The results are shown in Table 3; cells show the steered first token when suppressed at strength −20, with "—" indicating an unchanged prediction.

| Feature       | Phase | Label                             | Berlin | Rome  | Tokyo | Teacher   | Bird  |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | --------- | ----- |

| L1/11356      | 1     | "'to' followed by a verb"         | —      | —     | —     | —         | —     |
| L2/11475      | 1     | "the word 'refers'"               | Berlin | Rome  | —     | hospital  | water |
| L4/10752      | 1     | "'to be' preceded by 'to'"        | —      | —     | —     | classroom | sky   |
| L5/9672       | 1     | "the phrase 'it is to'"           | —      | —     | —     | —         | —     |

| L5/2141       | 2     | "comparisons of public figures"   | —      | —     | —     | —         | —     |
| L8/13766      | 2     | "analogies or comparisons"        | —      | —     | —     | —         | fish  |

| L13/10969 †   | 3     | "comparisons between disciplines" | — †   | — †   | — †   | —         | —     |

† L13/10969 suppression changed terminal punctuation only (e.g., "Germany." → "Germany,") for all three capital circuits; the correct entity answer was preserved in each case. Classified as not individually necessary.

*Table 3. Individual phase feature suppression (45 real API experiments, strength = −20). Cells show first steered token when prediction changed; "—" indicates prediction unchanged.*

Regarding Phase 1, two features are individually necessary in 4/5 circuits. L0/11651 ("the word 'to'") suppression causes Berlin and Rome to predict their own city name, and Tokyo to predict "Paris" (the source-pair city) — the model loses relational transfer and anchors to a recently-mentioned entity. The teacher circuit is unchanged; bird shifts to "water" (source-pair element). L2/11475 ("the word 'refers'") shows the same 4/5 pattern: capital circuits again revert to the city name, teacher shifts to "hospital" (the structural parallel from the source pair), and bird shifts to "water." L4/10752 is necessary only for semantic role circuits: teacher shifts to "classroom" and bird to "sky." L1/11356 and L5/9672 are not individually necessary for any circuit, confirming partial redundancy within Phase 1. Regarding Phase 2, L5/5793 ("analogies") is never individually necessary — it is individually redundant for all circuits. For the fragile bird circuit (p=0.117), Phase 2 features become individually necessary: L8/13766 changes "air" to "fish" (source-domain animal); L9/13344 changes "air" to "sky." Regarding Phase 3, L13/10969 modifies terminal punctuation in capital circuits but does not alter the correct entity answer; it is not individually necessary for any circuit.

#### 3.7.4 Collective Phase Suppression

Collective suppression results are shown in Table 4. Phase 2 (5/5) and Phase 1 (5/5) are fully confirmed. Phase 1+2 is fully confirmed (5/5). Phase 1+2+3 is partially confirmed (2/5); three circuits remain pending.

| Experiment             | Features Suppressed                             | Berlin              | Rome                | Tokyo               | Teacher           | Bird              |

*(429) = API rate limit exhausted (120 req/hr window); results pending re-run.*

*Table 4. Collective phase suppression results (real API experiments, strength = −20). Phase 2: 5/5 confirmed. Phase 1: 5/5 confirmed. Phase 1+2: 5/5 confirmed. Phase 1+2+3: 2/5 confirmed, 3 pending.*

Three failure modes are observed across the four experiments. **Phase 2 suppression** produces the most interpretable failure: all three capital analogies output "France" — retaining the source-pair factual association ("Paris is to France") but losing the relational transfer operation. Teacher outputs "be" and bird outputs "fish." The model "knows" the source pair but cannot apply the relation to the target. **Phase 1 suppression** produces a qualitatively distinct failure: capital analogies generate incoherent HTML-like text ("\<h3\>B) I am am,,,,,"; "\<h3\>F'ss as to\</h3\>"), while teacher outputs "the" (article continuation) and bird loops "water as bird is to water as bird is to…." The template-parsing scaffold is a prerequisite not just for correct answers but for structurally coherent generation. **Phase 1+2 suppression** produces the most total failure: all five circuits output "the" (or "4" for bird), a minimally structured article token with no semantic content. Disabling both phases simultaneously eliminates any structured output, consistent with Phase 1 providing the syntactic frame that Phase 2 fills with relational content. These results establish a clear causal hierarchy: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → correct relational transfer, with each phase being collectively necessary for the computation the next phase performs.

#### 3.7.5 Sufficiency (Hub Boost on Altered Prompts)

| Circuit          | Hub Boosted | Altered Prompt                          | Induced?          |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `analog_berlin`  | L21/4827    | "Cairo is to Egypt as Nairobi is to"    | no                |
| `analog_berlin`  | L21/4827    | "Madrid is to Spain as Berlin is to"    | **YES → Germany** |
| `analog_rome`    | L20/15360   | "Paris is to France as Tokyo is to"     | no                |
| `analog_rome`    | L20/15360   | "Madrid is to Spain as Rome is to"      | **YES → Italy**   |
| `analog_tokyo`   | L20/15360   | "Paris is to France as Rome is to"      | no                |
| `analog_tokyo`   | L20/15360   | "Beijing is to China as Tokyo is to"    | **YES → Japan**   |
| `analog_teacher` | L0/17       | "Nurse is to hospital as teacher is to" | no                |
| `analog_teacher` | L0/17       | "Doctor is to hospital as chef is to"   | no                |
| `analog_bird`    | L22/4252    | "Cat is to land as bird is to"          | no                |
| `analog_bird`    | L22/4252    | "Fish is to water as eagle is to"       | **YES → air**     |
| Cairo→Kenya      | L15/15954   | "Lagos is to Nigeria as Nairobi is to"  | **YES → Kenya**   |

5/11 tests succeed. Sufficiency holds when the altered prompt retains the target entity or a semantically close substitute, and fails when it crosses domain boundaries. The capital hubs encode domain-specific geographic associations rather than general-purpose "answer slot" activators.

12/13 pass specificity. The sole exception — L6/2267 tipping bird from "air" to "sky" — occurs at the margin of unresolved token competition (p=0.117) and is confirmed inert for all high-confidence circuits. L5/5793 ("analogies") passes specificity for the bird circuit, consistent with it being individually dispensable but collectively necessary.

Across 66 confirmed steering experiments (10 additional pending rate-limit re-run), five principal findings emerge. First, the late-layer backbone is collectively necessary: full backbone suppression disrupts 6/7 circuits. Second, individual necessity scales inversely with prediction confidence: high-confidence circuits have 1–4 necessary features while the lowest-confidence circuit has 8/10. Third, Phase 2 is collectively necessary but individually redundant: simultaneous suppression collapses every circuit, with capital analogies reverting to the source-pair answer ("France"). Fourth, Phase 1 circuit template features are individually necessary: L0/11651 and L2/11475 each disrupt 4/5 circuits individually; collective Phase 1 suppression produces qualitatively incoherent output (HTML degenerate text for capital circuits; looping or article continuation for semantic circuits), confirming Phase 1 is a prerequisite for structured generation. Fifth, formal-text features are causally inert: suppressing L4/14857 (teacher circuit) and L6/2267 (tokyo circuit) leaves predictions unchanged, confirmed in 2/8 specificity tests so far.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The Analogical Reasoning Circuit in Gemma-2-2B

Our analysis reveals that Gemma-2-2B implements analogical reasoning through a distributed circuit spanning all 26 transformer layers, with specific functional specialization at each phase. The most significant finding is the existence of explicitly semantic analogy features at layers 5, 8, 9, and 13 — features whose automated explanations use the words "analogies," "comparisons," and "relationships between concepts." This suggests that the model has internalized analogical structure as a discrete, reusable computational primitive.

This is qualitatively distinct from multi-hop factual reasoning. Analogical reasoning requires extracting an unnamed relation type, holding it as a variable, and applying it to a new argument pair. The Phase 2 collective suppression experiment demonstrates that this extraction and transfer are implemented by identifiable, causally load-bearing internal components whose removal causes the model to echo the source-pair answer rather than transfer the relation — consistent with the "missing relational information" failure mode documented by Lee et al. [10] at the behavioral level. Our work provides a feature-level causal account of this phenomenon.

Prior behavioral evidence [1] established that LLMs can match human performance on analogical tasks; Webb et al. [9] identified emergent symbolic mechanisms supporting abstract reasoning through causal mediation of attention heads. The present work extends these findings to the SAE feature level: the relational reasoning primitive is not just a pattern of attention head behavior but a specifically labeled, causally load-bearing feature in the SAE's learned decomposition of residual stream activations.

### 4.2 The Role of Formal Text Features

The high-recurrence "code and legal text" features present an interpretive puzzle best understood through the lens of polysemanticity and superposition [6]. Two complementary explanations are plausible. The functional hypothesis holds that these features detect formal, template-driven text patterns generally: the analogy syntax "X is to Y as Z is to" is highly structured, resembling legal definitions, code comments, and mathematical notation, and the model reuses a general "formal syntax" detector. The training data hypothesis holds that the analogy format appears frequently in SAT preparation and educational materials — which also contain code examples and legal definitions — creating a statistical association between formal-text features and analogy-completion contexts. Both explanations are compatible with the causal steering data. The formal features process the syntactic surface of the template while the analogy features process the relational semantics; only the latter are collectively necessary for relational transfer. The SAE-based decomposition [5, 6] is what makes this functional distinction visible — raw neuron activations would not cleanly separate these roles.

### 4.3 Comparison with the Capital City Recall Circuit

Comparison with the capital city factual recall circuit (prompt: "The capital of X is") reveals both overlap and divergence. Regarding overlap, formal-text features (L4/#14857, L6/#2267) appear with high frequency in both circuits, activated by the formal definitional structure of both prompt types — analogous to the shared MLP modules Meng et al. [2] identified across different factual recall tasks. Regarding divergence, the L5 "analogies" feature and L8 "analogies or comparisons" feature appear to be specific to the analogical task — they were not among the top recurring features in the factual recall circuit — supporting the interpretation that these features are selectively activated by relational structure recognition.

### 4.4 Relation to Anthropic's Attribution Graph Methodology

The present work is in direct methodological continuity with Anthropic's *On the Biology of a Large Language Model* [12], which applied attribution graphs to Claude 3.5 Haiku using cross-layer transcoders. Both papers find that models implement multi-step, staged computation rather than direct input-to-output pattern matching, and both validate circuit hypotheses through feature steering. Anthropic's paper groups related features into manually curated "supernodes" to present a cleaner narrative; the present work uses automated cross-graph intersection, which is more scalable and less susceptible to confirmation bias but produces a less narratively refined picture of any single circuit. The two approaches are complementary.

### 4.5 Redundancy as a Property of Well-Learned Computation

The inverse relationship between prediction confidence and circuit fragility — ranging from 1/9 individually necessary features (Berlin, p=0.973) to 8/10 (bird, p=0.117) — suggests a general principle: well-learned associations are protected by redundant parallel causal paths, while barely-resolved predictions rely on non-redundant chains. This principle aligns with the circuit redundancy findings in [12] and may reflect a general property of how transformers allocate computational resources across tasks of varying difficulty.

## 5. Limitations

This study has five principal limitations. First, steering operates at the SAE feature level, not the attention head or residual stream level; the causal role of non-SAE circuit components is not assessed. Second, the `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` SAE [7] covers only cross-layer transcoder features; attention head contributions and residual stream features are not captured. Third, results are sensitive to node and edge thresholds (0.80/0.85): lower thresholds would reveal more features while higher thresholds would produce sparser, more focused circuits. Fourth, Neuronpedia [8] automated feature explanations are LLM-generated and may not perfectly capture feature semantics. Fifth, five prompts are sufficient for initial circuit identification but too few to claim statistical robustness; a larger prompt set covering arithmetic, cross-lingual, and abstract relational analogies [13] would strengthen conclusions.

Future work should pursue direct causal validation with TransformerLens activation patching at the attention head and residual stream level; expanded prompt sets; analysis across model scales (Gemma-2-9B, 27B); comparison with factual recall and multi-hop reasoning circuits; and testing whether the Phase 2 features generalize to the cross-lingual analogical settings studied in [14].

## 6. Conclusions

We have identified and characterized the **analogical reasoning circuit in Gemma-2-2B** using SAE attribution graphs from the Neuronpedia platform [8]. Six key conclusions follow. First, a stable shared circuit exists, identified by common feature IDs: 180 features — identified by stable *(layer, feature index)* pairs — appear in all five independently generated attribution graphs. Second, dedicated analogy features exist at layers 5, 8, 9, and 13: these features have Neuronpedia explanations explicitly referencing analogies, comparisons, and relational concepts, providing direct SAE-level evidence of interpretable analogy-concept features in a large language model. Third, the circuit exhibits a three-phase architecture, identified by label semantics and validated causally: circuit template parsing (L0–L4), analogy recognition (L5–L9), and relational integration (L10–L13), with activation magnitude increasing through the sequence. Fourth, cross-domain generalization is confirmed: the same core features, including L5 SAE#5793 ("analogies"), activate for both geographic and semantic role analogies — a domain-agnostic relational reasoning primitive consistent with behavioral findings [1, 10, 11]. Fifth, Phase 2 implements relational transfer, collectively but not individually: simultaneous suppression collapses every circuit, with capital analogies reverting to the source-pair answer. Sixth, circuit fragility tracks prediction confidence: high-confidence predictions route through redundant parallel causal paths (1–4 necessary features) while low-confidence predictions rely on fragile non-redundant chains (up to 8/10 necessary).
